      "Recently, cloud communications company Twilio Inc. announced plans to reduce its workforce by approximately 5%, or about 200 employees, as part of an effort to streamline its operations and achieve profitable growth. \n",

      "In a press release on December 4, 2023, the company estimated it would incur costs of $25-$35 million associated with the workforce reduction, which primarily comprise employee termination and severance payments, benefits, and related expenses. \n",
