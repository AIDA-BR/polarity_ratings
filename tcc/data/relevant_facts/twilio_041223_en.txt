Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
On December 4, 2023, Twilio Inc. (the “Company”, “we” or “our”) committed to a further workforce restructuring plan (the “December Plan”) intended to streamline operations and accelerate the Company's path to delivering profitable growth. The December Plan includes the elimination of approximately 5% of the Company's current workforce.
As a result of the December Plan, the Company estimates that it will incur approximately $25-$35 million in charges in connection with the workforce reduction, consisting of expenditures for employee transition, notice period and severance payments, employee benefits, and related facilitation costs, substantially all of which are expected to result in future cash outlays.
The Company expects that the majority of the restructuring charges related to the December Plan will be incurred in the fourth quarter of 2023 and that the execution of the December Plan, including cash payments, will be substantially complete by the end of the first quarter of 2024.
Potential position eliminations in each country are subject to local law and consultation requirements, which may extend this process beyond the first quarter of 2024 in certain countries. The charges that the Company expects to incur are subject to a number of assumptions, including local law requirements in various jurisdictions, and actual expenses may differ materially from the estimates disclosed above.
As part of the December Plan, Twilio Flex, the Company's cloud contact center, will be reported as part of the Company's Twilio Communications reportable segment in future periods. Prior periods presented for purposes of comparison will be recast accordingly
